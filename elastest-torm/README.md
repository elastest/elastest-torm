# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Build Notes

Note that by running `mvn clean install` the `maven-gpg-plugin` is executed, thus 
the passphrase in the `settings.xml` file must be configured. Usually this step
it is not required during the build in local, as any artifact has to be actually 
deployed. This configuration (i.e. `settings.xml` with a passphrase) is attached
in Jenkins Job.

In order to build and to test the module run `mvn clean package`.
Alternatively, comment the plugin configuration of the `maven-gpg-plugin` into
the `pom.xml` (only in local)
