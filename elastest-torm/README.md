elastest-torm
==============================

The Test Orchestration and Recommendation Manager (TORM) is the brain of ElasTest and the main entry point for developers. TORM will provide a web interface to be used by testers and administrators. It will also provide a remote API. That API will be used by ElasTest-CLI (a command line interface tool), by ElasTest Jenkins Plugin and by ElasTest Eclipse Plugin.

The ElasTest TORM component is currently in development. If you want to contribute to the ElasTest TORM project you need to read the [Development documentation](https://github.com/elastest/elastest-torm/blob/master/docs/index.md) 

What is ElasTest
-----------------

This repository is part of [ElasTest], which is an open source elastic platform
aimed to simplify end-to-end testing. ElasTest platform is based on three
principles: i) Test orchestration: Combining intelligently testing units for
creating a more complete test suite following the “divide and conquer” principle.
ii) Instrumentation and monitoring: Customizing the SuT (Subject under Test)
infrastructure so that it reproduces real-world operational behavior and allowing
to gather relevant information during testing. iii) Test recommendation: Using machine
learning and cognitive computing for recommending testing actions and providing
testers with friendly interactive facilities for decision taking.

Documentation
-------------

The [ElasTest] project provides detailed documentation including tutorials,
installation and development guide.
